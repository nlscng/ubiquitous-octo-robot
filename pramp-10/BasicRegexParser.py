# Basic Regex Parser Implement a regular expression function isMatch that supports the '.' and '*' symbols. The
# function receives two strings - text and pattern - and should return true if the text matches the pattern as a
# regular expression. For simplicity, assume that the actual symbols '.' and '*' do not appear in the text string and
# are used as special symbols only in the pattern string.
#
# In case you arenâ€™t familiar with regular expressions, the function determines if the text and pattern are the
# equal, where the '.' is treated as a single a character wildcard (see third example), and '*' is matched for a zero
#  or more sequence of the previous letter (see fourth and fifth examples). For more information on regular
#   expression matching, see the Regular Expression Wikipedia page.
#
# Explain your algorithm, and analyze its time and space complexities.
#
# Examples:
#
# input:  text = "aa", pattern = "a"
# output: false
#
# input:  text = "aa", pattern = "aa"
# output: true
#
# input:  text = "abc", pattern = "a.c"
# output: true
#
# input:  text = "abbb", pattern = "ab*"
# output: true
#
# input:  text = "acd", pattern = "ab*c."
# output: true
